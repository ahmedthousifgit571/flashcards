# UI Library: shadcn/ui

This project uses shadcn/ui for all UI components.

- If shadcn/ui is not initialized in the project, initialize it:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

- To add a specific component, use the add command (example for Button):

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add button
```

Replace `button` with any other component name as needed.
